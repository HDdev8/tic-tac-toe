# Tic Tac Toe

**Link to project:** https://hddev8.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I use CSS Grid for the layout. Players enter their names and are assigned "X" or "O". 

## Optimizations:

I would like to refactor according to SOLID principles. I would also like to enhance the currently plain design. The logic I use for determining the winner could certainly be simplified, which I would work in if I had more time. I would like to explore the use of template literals for streamlining the code further. I would also like to create an option for playing against the computer. 

## Lessons Learned:

I was excited to delete overly complicated code by using template literals for certain variables.
